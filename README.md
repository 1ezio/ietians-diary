### An application for sharing educational resources <br><br>
IETian's diary is a convenient application that allows students to share context-based resources
such as notes, previous year's exam papers, e-books, syllabus, assignments etc.

IETian's Diary was started by a group of IET students in their first year. Due to a lack of resources in their group at the time, they decided to create an app that would allow them to share resources such as previous year papers, study material such as books, notes, and assignments, among other things.
It was a huge hit with the student community at the time because nothing like it had ever been done before.
Students began using this app by sharing their resources with one another, and this is how IETian's diary came to be.

The application was working fine but progress is the law of nature,that is, many features of the application became obsolete and now it was the right time to upgrade.

Since the project was developed by students in their first year, the project code was not that maintainable and scalable so we decided to start from scratch.
